# The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1) - Report



**Introduction**

In this week's submission, I have selected to use the city of Toronto and find neighborhoods that would be best suited for a restaraunt. This is created in a way to allow a person to get a brief knowledge into who will be the target market for a certain area based on the overall population of that area.



**Business Problem**

Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of 
small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.

Toronto's neighborhood is divided into multiple types ranging from Old Toronto to Suburbs to Industrial areas. Toronto also is the most populous city in Canada and has a really diverse population allowing it to become an important destination to a lot of immigrants arriving to Canada. 

This diversity as well as the sheer size of the city itself makes it really difficult for a new business to decide what area would be most suited for their business in such a way that they can maximize their profit without worrying about as less competition as possible.

Thus, thats the idea behind this project as a way to allow new business with some knowledge on where and when to open a new business in an area.
